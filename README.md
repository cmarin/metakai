# Metakai Filter Suite

A device-agnostic, browser-based image manipulation playground that reimagines classic 1990s Photoshop plug-ins for today's web stack. Apply real-time, tactile visual effects directly on phones, tablets, and desktop computers.

## Features

### Core Filters (MVP)
- **Liquify**: Warp and distort images with liquid-like effects (smear, twirl, pinch, swell)
- **Convolve**: Apply mathematical filters for sharpening, blurring, edge detection, and emboss effects
- **Gel Paint**: Paint with realistic 3D materials that interact with light (planned)

### Technical Highlights
- âš¡ Real-time WebGL processing with 60fps performance
- ðŸ“± Progressive Web App (PWA) - installable and works offline
- ðŸŽ¨ Responsive design supporting mobile, tablet, and desktop
- ðŸŒ“ Dark/light theme with system preference detection
- â™¿ WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility compliant
- ðŸ§ª Comprehensive testing with 95%+ coverage goal

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd metakai-filter-suite
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Build optimized production bundle |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint code quality checks |
| `npm run test` | Run unit tests with Vitest |
| `npm run test:ui` | Run tests with Vitest UI |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Generate test coverage report |
| `npm run cypress:open` | Open Cypress for interactive E2E testing |
| `npm run cypress:run` | Run Cypress tests headlessly |

## Usage

1. **Upload an image** using the "Upload Image" button (supports JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF â‰¤ 12MB)
2. **Select a filter** from the toolbar (Liquify, Convolve, Gel Paint)
3. **Adjust controls** in the right panel to customize the effect
4. **Apply the filter** and use undo/redo as needed
5. **Export your result** (feature in development)

### Navigation Controls
- **Pan**: Click and drag on the canvas to move the image
- **Zoom**: Use mouse wheel or pinch gestures on touch devices
- **Zoom buttons**: Use the zoom controls in the bottom-right corner
- **Reset view**: Click the reset button to return to original position

### Supported Image Formats
- JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF
- Maximum file size: 12MB
- Auto-orientation based on EXIF data

#### iPhone/HEIC Support
HEIC/HEIF images from iPhones are not natively supported by web browsers. To use photos from your iPhone:
1. Change your iPhone camera settings to capture in JPEG format (Settings â†’ Camera â†’ Formats â†’ Most Compatible)
2. Export as JPEG from the Photos app before uploading
3. Use an online HEIC to JPEG converter
4. The app will detect HEIC files and provide guidance

## Filter Architecture

Each filter extends the base `Filter` class and implements:
- GLSL vertex/fragment shaders for WebGL processing
- Control definitions for UI generation
- Real-time parameter updates
- Undo/redo state management

Example filter structure:
```typescript
export class LiquifyFilter extends Filter {
  getName(): string { return 'Liquify' }
  getDefaultControls(): FilterControl[] { /* ... */ }
  createFilter(): PixiFilter { /* WebGL filter setup */ }
  protected updateFilter(): void { /* Parameter updates */ }
}
```

## Browser Support

| Platform | Minimum Version |
|----------|----------------|
| **Desktop** | Chrome 90+, Edge 90+, Safari 14+, Firefox 88+ |
| **Mobile** | iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Mobile 90+ |
| **Android** | Chrome 90+ on Android 8+ |

**Required APIs:**
- WebGL 2.0
- ES2020 features
- Service Workers (for PWA)
- File API
